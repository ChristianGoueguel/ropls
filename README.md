# ropls
The ropls R package implements the PCA, PLS(-DA) and OPLS(-DA) approaches with the original, NIPALS-based, versions of the algorithms (Wold, Sjostrom, and Eriksson 2001; Trygg and Wold 2002). It includes the R2 and Q2 quality metrics (Eriksson et al. 2001; Tenenhaus 1998), the permutation diagnostics (Szymanska et al. 2012), the computation of the VIP values (Wold, Sjostrom, and Eriksson 2001), the score and orthogonal distances to detect outliers (Hubert, Rousseeuw, and Vanden Branden 2005), as well as many graphics (scores, loadings, predictions, diagnostics, outliers, etc).
